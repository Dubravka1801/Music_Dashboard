# Music_Dashboard
My music data is being shown in Tableau dashboards. Main goal was to make dashborad which is easy to navigate through a lot of different genres.
Focus was on building dashborad in which each of sheets surves as filter to another sheet, so it would be easy to get info on different genres, years, artists or albumes.
First dashboard includes all genres and second dashboars shows top 20 genres.
